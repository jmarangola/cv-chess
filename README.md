# Runnable Scripts and Commands 
All .ipynb files should run when the proper path is added to the respective files. In the README.md for the chess_piece_classifier folder, the necessary datasets are linked.  

For the neural network code, go to "chess-piece-classifier folder" and the main neural network will be called "PieceClassifier.ipynb"

All robotics code can be found in the "robotics" folder in "core". 

All other python programs mainly pertain to image preprocessing and can be found in the "vision" folder under "core". However, these don't need to be ran to run the neural network as the data that is provided has already been through the necessary preprocessing.
